Transiting Planet Candidates Search
===============

One of the methods to detect exoplanets is the transit method. In this method, we observe the light curve data (such as ones collected by Kepler) and look for characteristic transiting curves. Whenever a planet transits in front of its parent star's disk, the observed flux of the star decreases. Observed over a long period of time this results in a characteristic curve from which one can obtain important information such as the period of the planet's orbit, etc.
