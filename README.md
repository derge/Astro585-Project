Transiting Planet Candidates Search
===============

One of the methods to detect exoplanets is the transit method. In this method, we observe the light curve data (such as ones collected by Kepler) and look for characteristic transiting curves. Whenever a planet transits in front of its parent star's disk, the observed flux of the star decreases and since the planet's orbit around the star is periodic in nature, this gives rise to a characteristic curve when the observed flux is observed over a long period of time.
